](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/in-memory-analytics-with-apache-arrow-9781835461228), published by Packt.

**Accelerate data analytics for efficient processing of flat and hierarchical data structures**

## What is this book about?
Apache Arrow is an open source, columnar in-memory data format designed for efficient data processing and analytics. This book harnesses the authorâ€™s 15 years of experience to show you a standardized way to work with tabular data across various programming languages and environments, enabling high-performance data processing and exchange.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use Apache Arrow libraries to access data files, both locally and in the cloud
* Understand the zero-copy elements of the Apache Arrow format
* Improve the read performance of data pipelines by memory-mapping Arrow files
* Produce and consume Apache Arrow data efficiently by sharing memory with the C API
* Leverage the Arrow compute engine, Acero, to perform complex operations
* Create Arrow Flight servers and clients for transferring data quickly
* Build the Arrow libraries locally and contribute to the community
